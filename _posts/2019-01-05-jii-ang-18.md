title:  A Factor Analysis of North America MSCI Index
comments: false
---



Today I would like to review [Whats in Your Benchmark? A Factor Analysis of Major Market Indexes](https://jii.iijournals.com/content/9/2/66) paper.

Authors show which factors are in major market indexes and describe how the factor exposures vary over time.
Theirs methodology was to construct a factor-mimicking portfolio of any market index using cross-sectional risk attributes.
They found that most cap-weighted indexes are effectively exposed to only two or three factors, 
with value and momentum being increasingly prevalent. Below I have a snapshot of factor exposures for single country
indexes. For example, for S&P500 as of March-2017, a factor mimicking portfolio has
- 26.2% exposure to Momentum
- 0.0% exposure to LowVol
- 27.2% exposure to Value
- 0.0% exposure to LowSize
- 46.6% exposure to Quality

I would like to attribute [MSCI North America](https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/46aa6590-4ca0-4bfb-bc51-3ca9c297c4ff) index (**Benchmark**) against those factors. I will used
constrained least squares to do it.

So most recent exposure for North America MSCI Index is driven by LowSize, Quality and Value.
