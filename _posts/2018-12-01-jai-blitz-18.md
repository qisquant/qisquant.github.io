title:  Are Hedge Funds on the Other Side of the Low-Volatility Trade?
comments: false

Today I would like to review [Are Hedge Funds on the Other Side of the Low-Volatility Trade?](https://jai.iijournals.com/content/21/1/17) paper.
The main conclusions of the paper that instead of trying to exploit the low-volatility anomaly, hedge funds seem to be betting against it; that is, going long high-volatility stocks and short low-volatility stocks.
Let's run similar analysis.

The methodology of constructing hedge fund indexes can be found in [HFRI Hedge Fund Indices](https://www.hedgefundresearch.com/sites/default/files/pdf/HFRI_formulaic_methodology.pdf).


I constructed explanatory factors in the same way as it was proposed in the article (outlined below) except that I am not using Risklab Variance Premium Trading index. 

 1. The equity premium (the U.S. equity market excess return provided by Kenneth French), denoted by Mkt;
 2. The 1-month lagged equity premium, denoted by Mkt-1;
 3. The return difference between emerging and U.S. equity markets (MSCI Emerging Markets index return minus the U.S. equity market return), denoted by EM-US;
 4. The term premium (Barclays US Treasury index return minus the risk-free return), denoted by Term;
 5. The credit risk premium on investment grade corporate bonds (Barclays US Corporate Investment Grade index return minus Barclays US Treasury index return), denoted by IG-Tr;
 6. The credit risk premium on high yield corporate bonds (Barclays US Corporate High Yield index return minus Barclays US Treasury index return), denoted by HY-Tr;
 7. The return on time-series momentum strategies applied to commodities, equity indexes, bonds, and currencies, based on obtained from [ Tobias J. Moskowitz Yao Hua Ooi Lasse H. Pedersen](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Journal-Article/Time-Series-Momentum)
 8. The standard Fama-French size, value, and momentum factors,denoted by SMB, HML, and Mom respectively.

As can be seen, Low volatility factor and Low Beta factors both have significant t-values and both of them negative which is in agreement with the paper.
