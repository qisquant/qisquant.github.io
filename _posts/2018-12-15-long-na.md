Today I would like to construct long only Momentum, LowVol, LowSize, Value, Quality and Composite factors using US and Canada universe of stocks.

The long-short optimized factors I already built in my previous posts outlined here:
  
 - [Momentum Factor - North America](https://qisresearch.github.io/momentum-na)
 - [Volatility Factor - North America](https://qisresearch.github.io/volatility-na)
 - [Size Factor - North America](https://qisresearch.github.io/size-na)
 - [Value Factor - North America](https://qisresearch.github.io/value-na)
 - [Quality Factor - North America](https://qisresearch.github.io/quality-na)
 - [Composite Factor - North America](https://qisresearch.github.io/composite-na)

Universe of stocks:  large and mid cap names of the US and Canada markets with approximately 750 stocks.

Factors: 

 1. Momentum - Mom.12m.1m (12m rolling returns with skipping most recent month)
 2. LowVol   - Vol.6m (6m rolling volatility)
 3. LowSize  - Log.Mcap (log of market capitalization)
 4. Value 
    - OCF (Operating cash flow)
    - PE (Price to earning ratio)
    - BP (Book to price ratio)
    - DVD (Dividend yield)
 5. Quality 
    - ROE (Return on equity)
    - OP (Operating leverage)
    - GM (Gross margin)
    - OCFB (Operating cash flow to book price)

Signal: (common to each of factor)
 
 1. Z-scored on [GICS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard) levels.
 2. Outliers winsorized.
 3. Buy high Z-score names, sell low Z-score names. (opposite for LowSize and LowVol)

Strategy constrains:
 
 1. Each stock weighted proportionally to the weight in the parent index.
 2. Overall leverage kept at 100%.
 3. Buy top 20% of names sorted by the signal.
 4. Compute signal every month end.
 5. Execute trades on first business day of the month.
 
 
Performance and statistics for the long only factors.
