title:  Modular and Integrated Approaches to Factor Portfolio Construction

Today I would like to review [Modular and Integrated Approaches to Factor Portfolio Construction](https://jii.iijournals.com/content/8/4/85) paper.

The paper review two approaches which are used to combine factors.
The first is to construct portfolios that capture a single factor in isolation and add these portfolios together
to build a modular portfolio of factor building blocks (or top down portfolio). The second is to consider all factors holistically
and build an integrated portfolio (or bottom up portfolio).

Let's mix factors using both approaches.

Universe of stocks:

  - Large and mid cap names of the US and Canada markets with approximately 750 stocks.(**US**)
  - Large and mid cap names of 15 developed countries in Europe with approximately 500 stocks.(**EU**)
  
Type of Strategies

  1. US universe with bottom up portfolio construction (**US.BU**). I use the same method as in [Composite Factor - North America](https://qisresearch.github.io/composite-na).
  2. EU universe with bottom up portfolio construction (**EU.BU**). I use the same method as in [Composite Factor - Europe](https://qisresearch.github.io/composite-eu).
  3. US universe with equally weighting [Momentum](https://qisresearch.github.io/momentum-na), [Value](https://qisresearch.github.io/value-na), 
     [Size](https://qisresearch.github.io/size-na), [Value](https://qisresearch.github.io/value-na) and [Quality](https://qisresearch.github.io/quality-na). (**US.TD.EW**)
  4. US universe with Risk Parity optimization of [Momentum](https://qisresearch.github.io/momentum-na), [Value](https://qisresearch.github.io/value-na), 
     [Size](https://qisresearch.github.io/size-na), [Value](https://qisresearch.github.io/value-na) and [Quality](https://qisresearch.github.io/quality-na). (**US.TD.RP**)
  5. EU universe with equally weighting [Momentum](https://qisresearch.github.io/momentum-eu), [Value](https://qisresearch.github.io/value-eu), 
     [Size](https://qisresearch.github.io/size-eu), [Value](https://qisresearch.github.io/value-eu) and [Quality](https://qisresearch.github.io/quality-eu). (**EU.TD.EW**)
  6. EU universe with Risk Parity optimization of [Momentum](https://qisresearch.github.io/momentum-eu), [Value](https://qisresearch.github.io/value-eu), 
     [Size](https://qisresearch.github.io/size-eu), [Value](https://qisresearch.github.io/value-eu) and [Quality](https://qisresearch.github.io/quality-eu). (**US.TD.RP**)

As can be seen, in EU and US regions integrated portfolio outperforming the modular portfolios both with equally weighting and risk parity optimization.
