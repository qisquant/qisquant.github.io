title:  Using Constraints to Amplify Factor-Based Indexes

Today I would like to review [Accentuate the Positive, Eliminate the Negative: Using Constraints to Amplify Factor-Based Indexes?](https://jii.iijournals.com/content/8/4/93) paper.

They have shown that using constraints during the construction of factor-based indexes can improve the factor efficiency
of the portfolioas measured by both exposure per unit of tracking risk and by the portion of systematic tracking risk coming
from the intended factor bets.

Let's check those conclusions by constructing long-short momentum factor using US and Canada universe of stocks.

The momentum factor will be constructed according to the methodology outlined in [Momentum Factor - North America](https://qisresearch.github.io/momentum-na).
I built this factor using optimization with several constrains, but I did not used sectors of countries constrains. Let's check how adding those constrains can improve momentum factor.

Country and sector constrains :

 1. Default momentum strategy [Momentum Factor - North America](https://qisresearch.github.io/momentum-na) (**Mom**)
 2. Momentum factor constructed with exposure constrained by sectors +- 1%, countries +- 5%. (**Mom.S1.C5**)
 3. Momentum factor constructed with exposure constrained by sectors +- 1%.                  (**Mom.S1**)
 4. Momentum factor constructed with exposure constrained by sectors +- 5%.                  (**Mom.S5**)
 5. Momentum factor constructed with exposure constrained by countries +- 1%.                (**Mom.C1**)
 6. Momentum factor constructed with exposure constrained by countries +- 5%.                (**Mom.C5**)

As can be seen adding country or sector or both constrains helps generally improve overall performance of the factor which is in agreement with the paper.
