Today I would like to review [Smart Beta Multifactor Construction Methodology: Mixing versus Integrating](https://jii.iijournals.com/content/8/4/47) paper.

Authors review two approaches which are used to combine factors. I have reviewed recently another paper which deals with the same topic in [Modular and Integrated Approaches to Factor Portfolio Construction](https://qisresearch.github.io/jii-romahi-18).

I will take long-only Momentum, LowVol, LowSize, Value, Quality, Integrating and Mixing strategies as defined in [Long Factors - North America](https://qisresearch.github.io/long-na) and analyze
tracking errors with respect to [MSCI North America](https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/46aa6590-4ca0-4bfb-bc51-3ca9c297c4ff), excess returns,  explained risk, active risk and idiosyncratic risk in similar fashion like it was done in above paper.

The integrating approach (which ranks and selects securities on the basis of a composite score) tends to demonstrate in-sample performance advantage comparing with mixing approach which is in agreemenet with the paper.
